# SJSU ML Club's Ribonanza Project
SJSU ML Club's attempt at the [Kaggle Ribonanza project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding/) hosted by Stanford.

Currently, we have three approaches (`ribonanza.ipynb`, `ribonanza2.ipynb`, and `ribonanza3.ipynb`). The latest notebook
(and the best place to get started) is `ribonanza3.ipynb`. For information on what needs to be done, check out the
`TODO` section in `ribonanza3.ipynb`.
