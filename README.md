# SJSU ML Club's Ribonanza Project
SJSU ML Club's attempt at the [Kaggle Ribonanza project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding/) hosted by Stanford.

Currently, we have two approaches (`ribonanza.ipynb` and `ribonanza2.ipynb`). For information on what needs to be done, check out the
individual notebooks' `TODO` sections.
